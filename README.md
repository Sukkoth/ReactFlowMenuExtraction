# ReactFlow Menu Extraction and Visualization

## Introduction

Welcome to my solution for EPhone's Recruitment Challenge! This project demonstrates my skills in building a React application using TypeScript and ReactFlow. In this challenge, I focused on implementing menu extraction and visualization functionalities as per the provided requirements.

## Project Overview

This project aims to extract menu items from text input and visualize them using ReactFlow. The extracted menu items are displayed in a structured format, and users can interact with them on the ReactFlow canvas.

## Features

Menu Extraction: Implemented regular expression-based extraction of menu items formatted as "\<number\>. \<Menu Text\>".
ReactFlow Integration: Enabled node addition, deletion, duplication, and edge connections on the ReactFlow canvas.

## Usage

Paste Text: Enter text containing potential menu structures into the text area on the left panel.
Extract Menu Items: Click the "Extract" button to trigger the extraction process.
Visualize Menu Items: View the extracted menu items displayed in a structured format on the left panel.
Interact with Nodes: Use the ReactFlow canvas on the center panel to interact with nodes, add/delete/duplicate nodes, and connect them with directional edges.
